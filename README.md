# Analyze A/B Test Results
## The Goal
In this project, The goal is to understand the results of an A/B Test run by an e-commerce website. A new webpage is developed to increase the number of people who decide to pay for the company's product. The results of the test will help a company decide if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make their decision. 

## Project's Parts
The project is split into three parts, and They are as follows:
#### Part One: Probability
#### Part Two: A/B Test
#### Part Three: A regression approach

## Results
